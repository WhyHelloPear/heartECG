# heartECG

Objective
Our project topic covers the analysis of ECG’s (electrocardiogram) of patient heartbeats to classify heart conditions.  There are five classification categories.  Zero denotes normal case and one through four denotes a certain type of heart abnormality.  Each instance within our dataset represents an “image” of a patient’s ECG over a 187 millisecond time interval where each millisecond is represented with a normalized data point that captures the ECG value at that given point in time. Our first objective is to use/test several classification models to find which models provide the highest overall accuracy.  The study which we obtained the data used a CNN (convoluted neural network) model https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00794.pdf, however we wanted to know if a RNN (recurrent neural network) could produce better results since the data is time based.  We also want to see if we can reproduce the original study’s results with CNN.
